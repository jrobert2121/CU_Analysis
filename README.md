# CU Analysis

## Overview
Analyze credit union data on the National Credit Union Administation's website and provide recommendations for MSUFCU.  MSUFCU is the second largest credit union in the state of Michigan with total assets of $6.8B, as of March 2022.  The credit union is on track to reach $10B in total assets in the next few years.  Currently, there are only 19 credit unions within the U.S. that have reached over $10B in total assets and only one credit union located in Michigan.  MSUFCU is poised to be the 2nd credit union within Michigan to achieve this level.

## Results
### Credit Cards
MSUFCU has a significant number of unsecured credit card loans in their lending portfolio. 38.7% of the total number of loans is compromised of credit cards.  The delinquency in this portfolio is quite low at .52%.  Credit cards have rebounded for MSUFCU over Q1 2021, which saw a substantial downturn from Q1 in 2020 and 2019.  This appears to be consistent with Michigan credit unions over $3B in assets.

MSUFCU members tend to carry a higher balance, despite MSUFCU reporting the highest interest rate of the measured credit unions.  In fact, the Q1 interest rate is 800 basis points higher than the reported Q1 2021 rate for MSUFCU.  It is unknown if this is a reporting error or an intential rate increase.  If the rate increase was intential, then it would indicate that members are likely using the MSUFCU credit card for value added benefits despite the higher rate.  Yet, it may also be a deterent for many as MSUFCU has over $1B in unfunded credit card lines.

With only 22.7% of available credit card lines being utilized, this is an area where MSUFCU can focus to increase dollars on these lines.  Increasing the total lines utilized by just 100 basis would bring MSUFCU back to and even exceeding prior balances from 2020 and 2019.  With the low portfolio delinquency, this is an area that seems to be a reasonable risk for MSUFCU.  MSUFCU should consider providing credit line increases to qualifying members who are active users of the product, reviewing underwriting guidelines to potentially take on more deeper credit risk, continued marketing of the strong value added benefits of the program, and even re-evaluating any staff incentive for credit card sales.
